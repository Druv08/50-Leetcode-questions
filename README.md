## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Understand, Don't Memorize:** Focus on understanding the approach rather than memorizing solutions
2. **Time Yourself:** Practice under time constraints (30-45 minutes per problem)
3. **Talk Through Your Solution:** Practice explaining your approach out loud
4. **Test Edge Cases:** Always consider edge cases before finalizing your solution
5. **Optimize Space & Time:** After getting a working solution, think about optimizations
6. **Review Mistakes:** Keep a log of mistakes and review them regularly
7. **Mock Interviews:** Practice with friends or use platforms like Pramp

---

## 🎯 Interview Strategy

### During the Interview:
1. **Clarify the Problem:** Ask questions to understand requirements
2. **Discuss Approach:** Explain your thinking before coding
3. **Start Simple:** Begin with a brute force solution if needed
4. **Optimize:** Improve time/space complexity
5. **Test Your Code:** Walk through test cases
6. **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider null, empty, and boundary conditions

### Time Management:
- **5 minutes:** Understand problem and ask clarifications
- **5-10 minutes:** Discuss approach and get feedback
- **20-25 minutes:** Code the solution
- **5-10 minutes:** Test and debug
